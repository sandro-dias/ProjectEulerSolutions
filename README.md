# ProjectEulerSolutions
This is the repository where I store my solutions to the problems listed on ProjectEuler's site: https://projecteuler.net/

As I say on my profile, I love to solve problems with technology. 
Mathematics is one of the areas I like the most because it demands a clear and logical way of thinking to solve complex problems.
So, I am using Python to try solving Project Euler's problems, which are very interesting.
